        "\n",
        "Stationarity is a fundamental concept in time series analysis that refers to the property of a time series where its statistical characteristics, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, remain constant over time. A stationary time series is easier to model and predict since its behavior does not change over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, a time series $X_t$ is stationary if:\n",
        "1. $E[X_t] = \\mu$ (mean is constant over time),\n",
        "2. $\\text{Var}[X_t] = \\sigma^2$ (variance is constant over time),\n",
        "3. Covariance $\\text{Cov}[X_t, X_{t+k}]$ depends only on $k$ (the lag), not $t$.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Types of Stationarity**\n",
        "1. **Strict Stationarity**: The joint distribution of $X_t$ remains unchanged over time.\n",
        "2. **Weak Stationarity (Second-order Stationarity)**: Only the mean, variance, and autocovariance are invariant over time. This is the most commonly used type of stationarity in time series analysis.\n",

        "**Why Does Stationarity Matter?**\n",
